## 3. Architecture Overview

### 3.1 Application Layers

The application follows a refined layered architecture with clear separation of concerns:

1. **Presentation Layer (UI):** (`music_player/ui/`) Handles user interaction and displays information. Built using PyQt6 widgets with comprehensive video and overlay support. Includes dashboard orchestration and specialized player components.

2. **Business Logic Layer (Managers):** (`music_player/models/`) Encapsulates domain-specific logic in dedicated manager classes:

   - `PositionManager`: Auto-save functionality with SQLite persistence
   - `SubtitleManager`: Subtitle track processing and language detection
   - `MediaManager`: File validation and media preparation
   - `ClippingManager`: Multi-segment media clipping functionality

3. **Application Control Layer:** (`music_player/ui/vlc_player/main_player.py`, `dashboard.py`) Orchestrates interaction between UI and business logic. Delegates complex operations to manager classes while maintaining UI coordination.

4. **Backend/Service Layer:** (`music_player/models/vlc_backend.py`, `music_player/services/`) Provides core functionalities like media playback and external service integration. Abstracts underlying libraries (VLC, network services).

5. **Framework Layer:** (`qt_base_app/`) Provides reusable base components, configuration, theming, and window management for code reuse across Qt applications.

### 3.2 Core Design Patterns

- **Model-View-Controller (MVC):** Clear separation between UI (View), managers/backend (Model), and main player (Controller) with signal-based communication.
- **Observer Pattern:** Extensive use of Qt's Signal/Slot mechanism for decoupled component communication.
- **Manager Pattern:** Business logic encapsulated in dedicated manager classes with well-defined responsibilities.
- **Singleton:** Used for global resources like `SettingsManager`, `ThemeManager`, and domain managers.
- **Composition over Inheritance:** Complex widgets built by composing specialized components.

### 3.3 Component Architecture

The UI employs a sophisticated composition model:

- `MusicPlayerDashboard`: Main window with integrated persistent player
- `MainPlayer`: Central controller with manager delegation
- `PlayerPage`: Dual-mode display (video widget / album art) with overlay system
- `VideoWidget`: Hardware-accelerated video rendering with fullscreen support
- `PlayerWidget`: Persistent bottom-bar player with comprehensive controls
- **Manager Classes**: Encapsulated business logic (Position, Subtitle, Media, Clipping)
- **Page System**: Modular views (Dashboard, Player, Playlists, Browser, Youtube, Preferences)

### 3.4 Data Flow (Example: Unified File Loading)

1. **User Action:** Clicks file in browser or recently played items
2. **Signal Emission:** Component emits `play_single_file_requested(filepath)`
3. **Unified Handler:** Dashboard routes to `MainPlayer._unified_load_single_file()`
4. **Manager Validation:** `MediaManager.prepare_media_for_loading()` validates file
5. **Position Save:** `PositionManager.handle_position_on_media_change()` saves current position
6. **Backend Loading:** `VLCBackend.load_media()` with hardware acceleration
7. **Metadata Processing:** Automatic video detection and subtitle processing
8. **Position Restore:** `PositionManager.get_saved_position()` restores saved position
9. **UI Updates:** Automatic mode switching (video/audio) and metadata display
10. **State Synchronization:** All components updated through signal propagation

### 8.5 Manager Pattern Refactoring

**Code Simplification Achievement:**

The recent refactoring successfully moved complex business logic from MainPlayer into dedicated manager classes, resulting in significant code reduction and improved maintainability:

```python
# Before: MainPlayer._periodic_position_save() - 25 lines of complex logic
def _periodic_position_save(self):
    if not self.current_media_path or not self.is_playing():
        return
    # ... 20+ lines of position validation, thresholds, saving logic

# After: MainPlayer._periodic_position_save() - 8 lines, delegated to manager
def _periodic_position_save(self):
    if not self.current_media_path or not self.is_playing():
        return
    current_pos = self.backend.get_current_position()
    current_duration = self.backend.get_duration()
    # Delegate to PositionManager for all business logic
    success, new_last_saved = self.position_manager.handle_periodic_save(
        self.current_media_path, current_pos, current_duration, self.last_saved_position)
    if success:
        self.last_saved_position = new_last_saved
```

**Refactoring Benefits:**

- **MainPlayer Simplified:** Reduced from ~1650 lines to focused coordination logic
- **Testable Business Logic:** Managers can be unit tested independently
- **Single Responsibility:** Each manager handles one domain area
- **Reduced Coupling:** Clear interfaces between UI and business logic
- **Code Reusability:** Managers can be used by other components

**Manager Responsibilities:**

- **PositionManager:** All position saving/restoring logic with SQLite integration
- **SubtitleManager:** Subtitle track processing and language detection
- **MediaManager:** File validation and media preparation
- **ClippingManager:** Multi-segment clipping functionality

## 9. Advanced Features

### 9.1 Auto-Save Position System

**Hybrid Saving Strategy:**

- **Event-driven saves:** Media changes, app shutdown, manual actions
- **Periodic saves:** 10-second timer during active playback
- **Position thresholds:** Only save meaningful positions (5s-end minus 10s)
- **Database optimization:** SQLite with proper indexing and cleanup

**Implementation Details:**

```python
# Timer management in _set_app_state()
if state == STATE_PLAYING:
    if not self.position_save_timer.isActive():
        self.position_save_timer.start()
else:
    if self.position_save_timer.isActive():
        self.position_save_timer.stop()
```

### 9.2 Space Bar Pause Functionality

**Recently Restored Feature:**
The `pause()` method in MainPlayer was recently restored to ensure proper Space Bar functionality:

```python
def pause(self):
    """Pause playback with automatic position saving"""
    # Save position when user manually pauses
    if self.current_media_path and self.backend.get_current_position():
        current_pos = self.backend.get_current_position()
        current_duration = self.backend.get_duration()
        # Use PositionManager for business logic delegation
        success, saved_position = self.position_manager.handle_manual_action_save(
            self.current_media_path, current_pos, current_duration, "pause"
        )
        if success:
            self.last_saved_position = saved_position

    # Set app state and backend pause
    self._set_app_state(STATE_PAUSED)
    result = self.backend.pause()
    return result
```

**Integration Points:**

- HotkeyHandler Space Bar mapping → MainPlayer.pause()

browser_page.play_single_file_requested.connect(player._unified_load_single_file)
youtube_page.play_file.connect(dashboard._handle_single_file_request)
```

**Manager-Based Event Flow:**

1. **UI Event:** User action triggers signal emission
2. **Routing:** Dashboard or page-level routing to appropriate handler
3. **Manager Delegation:** Business logic handled by specialized managers
4. **Backend Coordination:** MainPlayer coordinates VLC backend operations
5. **State Updates:** UI components updated through signal propagation

### 10.2 Auto-Save Event Integration

**Position Save Triggers:**

- Media loading with previous position save
- Timer-based periodic saves during playback
- Manual pause/stop actions
- Application shutdown
- Natural media end (clears saved position)

**Event Flow Example:**

```python
# Media change with position preservation
old_pos = self.backend.get_current_position()
success, saved_pos = self.position_manager.handle_position_on_media_change(
    old_path, new_path, old_pos, old_duration)
# Continue with new media loading...
```

### 10.3 Video Mode Event Handling

**Automatic Mode Switching:**

- Media type detection triggers UI mode changes
- Video widget shown/hidden based on content type
- Overlay visibility management during video playback
- Mouse tracking activation for video mode interactions

## 11. Development Workflow and Patterns

### 11.1 Manager Pattern Implementation

**Separation of Concerns:**

- UI components focus on user interaction and display
- Manager classes encapsulate domain-specific business logic
- MainPlayer acts as coordinator between UI and managers
- Clear interfaces and responsibility boundaries

**Example Manager Integration:**

```python
# Before: Complex logic in MainPlayer
if position_ms > 5000 and position_ms < (duration_ms - 10000):
    if abs(position_ms - self.last_saved_position) > 1000:
        # ... complex save logic

# After: Delegated to PositionManager
success, new_saved = self.position_manager.handle_periodic_save(
    path, position_ms, duration_ms, self.last_saved_position)
```
