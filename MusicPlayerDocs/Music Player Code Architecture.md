## 3. Architecture Overview

### 3.1 Application Layers

The application generally follows a layered architecture:

1.  **Presentation Layer (UI):** (`music_player/ui/`) Handles user interaction and displays information. Built using PyQt6 widgets and organized into pages and components. Includes the main dashboard (`dashboard.py`) and specific player UI elements (`vlc_player/`).
2.  **Application Logic/Control Layer:** (`music_player/ui/vlc_player/main_player.py`, `dashboard.py`) Orchestrates the interaction between the UI and the backend. Manages application state and connects signals/slots.
3.  **Backend/Service Layer:** (`music_player/models/vlc_backend.py`) Provides core functionalities like media playback. Abstracts the underlying library (VLC).
4.  **Framework Layer:** (`qt_base_app/`) Provides reusable base components, configuration, theming, and window management, aiming for code reuse across potential future Qt applications.

### 3.2 Core Design Patterns

*   **Model-View-Controller (MVC) / Model-View-Presenter (MVP) variants:** While not strictly enforced, the separation between UI (`View`), backend (`Model`), and control logic (`Controller/Presenter` - e.g., `MainPlayer`) is evident.
*   **Observer Pattern:** Qt's Signal/Slot mechanism is heavily used for communication between components, decoupling senders and receivers.
*   **Composition over Inheritance:** Widgets are often composed of smaller, specialized widgets (e.g., `PlayerWidget` contains `PlayerControls`, `PlayerTimeline`, etc.).
*   **Singleton:** Used for managing global resources like `SettingsManager` and `ThemeManager`.

### 3.3 Component Architecture

The UI is built by composing reusable widgets:

*   `MusicPlayerDashboard`: The main application window, containing the sidebar and page area.
*   `Sidebar`: Navigational component.
*   Pages (`PlayerPage`, `PlaylistsPage`, etc.): Displayed in the main content area.
*   `MainPlayer`: The controller coordinating the persistent player UI and the VLC backend.
*   `PlayerWidget`: The UI representation of the player (used persistently at the bottom).
    *   `PlayerControls`: Buttons for play/pause/next/previous.
    *   `PlayerTimeline`: Slider showing track progress.
    *   `VolumeControl`: Slider for volume.
    *   `AlbumArtDisplay`: Shows artwork thumbnail.
    *   `SpeedOverlay`: Shows playback speed changes.
*   `AlbumArtDisplay` (Large): Used on `PlayerPage`.

### 3.4 Data Flow (Example: Playback Start)

1.  **User Action:** Clicks the "Play" button (`PlayButton` within `PlayerControls`).
2.  **Signal Emission:** `PlayerControls` emits a `play_clicked` signal.
3.  **Widget Handling:** `PlayerWidget` catches this signal and emits its own `play_requested` signal.
4.  **Controller Action:** `MainPlayer` catches `play_requested` and calls the `play()` method on the `VLCBackend`.
5.  **Backend Action:** `VLCBackend` interacts with the `python-vlc` library to start playback.
6.  **State Change Signal:** `VLCBackend` detects a state change (e.g., to 'playing') and emits a `state_changed` signal.
7.  **Controller Update:** `MainPlayer` catches `state_changed`, updates its internal `app_state`, and potentially emits `playback_state_changed`.
8.  **UI Update:** `MainPlayer` calls `set_playing_state(True)` on `PlayerWidget`.
9.  **Widget Update:** `PlayerWidget` calls `set_playing_state(True)` on `PlayerControls`.
10. **Visual Change:** `PlayerControls` updates the appearance of the `PlayButton` (e.g., shows the "Pause" icon).

## 4. Core Framework (qt_base_app)

### 4.1 Purpose and Design Philosophy

The `qt_base_app` directory contains a set of reusable components and utilities designed to form a foundation for building Qt desktop applications. The philosophy is to promote code reuse, maintain consistency, and simplify common tasks like configuration, theming, and basic UI structure.

### 4.2 Configuration System (`qt_base_app/config`, `qt_base_app/models/settings_manager.py`)

*   Provides a way to load and manage application settings, likely from YAML files (as seen in `run.py`).
*   The `SettingsManager` acts as a singleton (`SettingsManager.instance()`) for global access to settings.
*   Supports getting and setting configuration values with type hints (`SettingType`).
*   Used by the music player for storing things like volume level and last directory.

### 4.3 Theming Engine (`qt_base_app/theme`)

*   Implements a `ThemeManager` singleton for managing application themes (e.g., colors).
*   Likely loads theme definitions from configuration files.
*   Provides methods like `get_color()` to retrieve theme-specific colors.
*   Used throughout the UI components (`PlayerPage`, `Dashboard`, etc.) to apply consistent styling dynamically.

### 4.4 Base Components (`qt_base_app/components`)

*   Contains fundamental UI building blocks intended for reuse or inheritance.
*   Examples likely include `BaseCard` (used in `PlayerPage`), `Sidebar`, etc.
*   These components often integrate with the `ThemeManager` for styling.

### 4.5 Window Management (`qt_base_app/window`, `qt_base_app/app.py`)

*   Provides base classes or utilities for the main application window.
*   Includes helper functions like `setup_dark_title_bar` (used in `run.py`) for platform-specific window customizations.

## 5. Media Backend (VLC Integration)

### 5.1 VLC Backend Architecture (`music_player/models/vlc_backend.py`)

The core media playback functionality is encapsulated within the `VLCBackend` class. This class serves as an abstraction layer over the `python-vlc` library, providing a simplified interface for the rest of the application to interact with media playback.

*   **Initialization:** Creates a VLC instance and a media player instance.
*   **Event Manager:** Attaches to VLC events (e.g., `MediaPlayerPositionChanged`, `MediaPlayerEndReached`, `MediaPlayerStateChanged`) to monitor playback status.
*   **Window Handle (`winId()`) Management for Video:** A crucial aspect of video playback is providing VLC with a valid window identifier (`winId()` on Qt, which corresponds to HWND on Windows) where it can draw the video. When a `VideoWidget` is re-parented between different top-level window contexts (e.g., from the main application window to a separate `FullScreenVideoHostWindow`), its `winId()` changes. This is because the `winId()` is tied to the native top-level window. `VLCBackend` must be updated with the new `winId()` via its `set_video_output()` method whenever such a re-parenting and context switch occurs to ensure continuous video rendering.
*   **Signal Emission:** Translates VLC events into Qt signals (`position_changed`, `duration_changed`, `state_changed`, `end_reached`, `error_occurred`, `media_loaded`) for consumption by the UI/Control layer.

### 5.2 Media Loading and Management

*   `load_media(file_path)`: Creates a VLC `Media` object from a file path.
*   Extracts metadata (title, artist, album, duration) asynchronously using `media.parse_with_options()`.
*   Attempts to extract and save embedded album artwork to a temporary file (`_extract_artwork`). The path to this temporary file is included in the emitted metadata.
*   Sets the loaded media onto the VLC media player instance.
*   Emits the `media_loaded` signal with the extracted metadata dictionary.

### 5.3 Playback Control

Provides methods mirroring standard media player actions:

*   `play()`: Starts or resumes playback.
*   `pause()`: Pauses playback.
*   `stop()`: Stops playback and releases the media.
*   `seek(position_ms)`: Seeks to a specific position in milliseconds.
*   `set_volume(volume)`: Sets the playback volume (0-200).
*   `set_rate(rate)`: Sets the playback speed (maintaining pitch).

### 5.4 Metadata Extraction

*   Metadata is primarily extracted when a new media file is loaded (`load_media`).
*   Uses `media.get_meta(vlc.Meta.*)` to retrieve standard tags.
*   Artwork extraction involves checking specific metadata fields (`vlc.Meta.ArtworkURL`) and potentially saving embedded art.
*   The extracted metadata (including the artwork file path) is bundled into a dictionary and emitted via signals.

### 5.5 Event System

*   Relies on the VLC event manager (`player.event_manager()`).
*   Callback functions (`_handle_position_changed`, `_handle_state_changed`, etc.) are registered for specific VLC events.
*   These callbacks translate the low-level VLC event data into higher-level Qt signals with relevant information (e.g., position in milliseconds, state strings like "playing", "paused").

## 6. User Interface Components

### 6.1 Dashboard Structure (`music_player/ui/dashboard.py`)

*   `MusicPlayerDashboard` is the main application window, inheriting from a base window class likely provided by `qt_base_app`.
*   **Initialization:** Sets up the main layout, sidebar, page container, and the persistent `MainPlayer` instance.
*   **Sidebar:** Uses a `Sidebar` component (likely from `qt_base_app`) for navigation between different application pages.
*   **Page Container:** A `QStackedWidget` to hold and switch between different page widgets (`PlayerPage`, `PlaylistsPage`, etc.).
*   **Persistent Player:** Instantiates `MainPlayer` and docks it at the bottom of the window.
*   **Page Management:** Connects sidebar signals (`item_selected`) to a slot (`on_sidebar_item_clicked`) that switches the active page in the `QStackedWidget` and updates the page title.
*   **Font Setup:** Contains logic (`setup_fonts`) to load and apply custom application fonts using `QFontDatabase`.

### 6.2 Component Hierarchy

The UI follows a component-based structure:

```
MusicPlayerDashboard
├── Sidebar
├── QStackedWidget (Page Container)
│   ├── DashboardPage
│   ├── PlayerPage
│   │   ├── AlbumArtDisplay (Large, Full Bleed, No Corners)
│   │   ├── QPushButton (Open File Button Overlay)
│   │   ├── RoundButton (Open File Button Overlay)
│   │   ├── RoundButton (OPlayer Button Overlay)
│   │   ├── UploadStatusOverlay (Overlay)
│   │   └── SpeedOverlay (Overlay)
│   ├── PlaylistsPage
│   └── PreferencePage
│   ├── BrowserPage
│   │   ├── QTableWidget (File Table)
│   │   ├── RoundButton (Browse Folder Overlay)
│   │   ├── RoundButton (OPlayer Upload Selected Overlay)
│   │   ├── UploadStatusOverlay (Overlay)
│   │   └── QLabel (Empty Message)
│   └── MainPlayer (Persistent Player Controller)
│       └── PlayerWidget (Persistent Player UI)
│           ├── AlbumArtDisplay (Thumbnail)
│           ├── PlayerControls
│           │   └── PlayButton
│           ├── PlayerTimeline
│           │   └── PlayHead
│           ├── VolumeControl
│           └── SpeedOverlay
```

### 6.3 Layout System

*   Primarily uses standard Qt layouts: `QVBoxLayout`, `QHBoxLayout`, and `QStackedWidget`.
*   Layouts are used within individual components and pages to arrange child widgets.
*   `PlayerPage` uses a `QVBoxLayout` with zero margins/spacing, placing the `AlbumArtDisplay` directly within it with a stretch factor to achieve a full-bleed background effect.
*   `QGridLayout` might be used in some base components but is not the primary layout mechanism seen in the music player specific code.
*   Manual positioning (`setGeometry` or `move`) is used for overlays (`SpeedOverlay`, `PlayHead`, and the buttons on `PlayerPage`) which can be less responsive (See Section 10.1). Positioning is relative to the parent widget.

### 6.4 Signal/Slot Communication

*   Extensive use of Qt's signal/slot mechanism for decoupling components.
*   **UI -> Control:** Buttons in `PlayerControls` emit signals (`play_clicked`), caught by `PlayerWidget`, which emits `play_requested`, caught by `MainPlayer`.
*   **Control -> Backend:** `MainPlayer` calls methods on `VLCBackend` (e.g., `play()`).
*   **Backend -> Control:** `VLCBackend` emits signals (`state_changed`, `position_changed`), caught by `MainPlayer`.
*   **Control -> UI:** `MainPlayer` calls methods on `PlayerWidget` to update its state/display (e.g., `set_playing_state`, `set_position`).
*   **Cross-Component:** `MainPlayer` also emits signals like `track_changed` which can be picked up by other components like `PlayerPage`.

### 6.5 Custom Widgets

Several custom widgets enhance the UI:

*   `PlayButton`: Animated play/pause button.
*   `CustomSlider`: Base class for custom-styled sliders.
*   `PlayerTimeline`, `VolumeControl`: Inherit from `CustomSlider` with specific appearances and functionality.
*   `PlayHead`: Visual indicator on the `PlayerTimeline`.
*   `AlbumArtDisplay`: Displays artwork with optionally rounded corners (via `corner_radius` parameter) and placeholders. Emits a `clicked` signal.
*   `SpeedOverlay`: Temporary indicator for playback speed.
*   `BaseCard`, `Sidebar` (from `qt_base_app`): Reusable structural elements.

### 6.6 UI Responsiveness

*   Standard layouts (`QVBoxLayout`, `QHBoxLayout`) provide basic responsiveness.
*   `resizeEvent` is overridden in some widgets (`PlayerWidget`, `PlayerPage`, `AlbumArtDisplay`) to handle manual repositioning or resizing of child elements (like overlays or album art) when the window size changes.
*   The manual positioning of overlays is less ideal for complex responsiveness (See Section 10.1).

### 6.7 Browser Page (`browser_page.py`)

**Purpose and Role:**

The `BrowserPage` serves as a simple file system browser integrated within the music player application. Its primary function is to allow users to navigate to a specific directory on their local machine and view its contents (files and subdirectories). This provides a convenient way to locate media files without leaving the application, although it doesn't currently offer deep library management features. It also incorporates functionality to upload selected files directly to an OPlayer device via FTP.

**UI Structure:**

The page presents a familiar file explorer interface. The main area is dominated by a `QTableWidget` (`file_table`) that lists the items in the currently selected directory. This table displays the filename (with appropriate icons indicating whether an item is a file or a directory), file size (or "<DIR>" for directories), and the last modified timestamp. Similar to other tables in the application, it supports column resizing and sorting.

When no directory is selected or if the selected directory is empty, the table is hidden, and a central `QLabel` (`empty_label`) displays an informative message to the user (e.g., "Select a folder to browse..." or "Directory is empty...").

Crucially, user interaction for selecting the directory to view is handled by an overlay button. A `RoundButton` component, displaying a folder icon, is persistently shown in the bottom-right corner of the page. Clicking this button triggers the directory selection dialog. A second `RoundButton`, labeled "OP", is positioned next to the browse button, allowing users to initiate uploads of selected files.

An `UploadStatusOverlay` is also included to provide visual feedback during file uploads initiated via the "OP" button.

**Functionality Breakdown:**

1.  **Directory Selection (`_browse_folder`):** When the user clicks the overlay `browse_button`, the `_browse_folder` method is invoked. It utilizes `QFileDialog.getExistingDirectory` to present a native dialog for folder selection. To enhance usability, the dialog remembers the last directory browsed by storing and retrieving the path using the `SettingsManager` under the key `'browser/last_browse_dir'`. Once a directory is chosen, its path is stored in `self._current_directory`, and the `_populate_table` method is called.

2.  **Table Population (`_populate_table`):** This method is responsible for filling the `file_table` with the contents of the specified `directory_path`. It first clears any existing rows. Then, it iterates through the items in the directory using `directory_path.iterdir()`. For each item, it attempts to get file statistics (`os.stat`) to determine if it's a directory, its size, and modification time. Errors during this process (e.g., permission denied) are caught and logged, skipping the problematic item. The gathered information is used to create appropriate `QTableWidgetItem` instances (reusing `SizeAwareTableItem` and `DateAwareTableItem` from the playlist components for correct sorting) and populate the table row. Icons are added to distinguish files from folders. After populating, sorting is re-enabled and applied based on the current sort column and order.

3.  **Automatic Loading (`showEvent`):** To improve user experience, the `BrowserPage` implements the `showEvent` method. When the page becomes visible, this event handler checks the `'browser/last_browse_dir'` setting. If a valid directory path is found and it's different from the currently displayed directory, the page automatically calls `_populate_table` to load its contents, saving the user from having to re-select the folder every time they navigate to the page.

4.  **OPlayer Upload (`_on_oplayer_upload_selected_clicked`, `_start_next_upload`, etc.):** This mirrors the functionality on the `PlayerPage` but is adapted for multiple files selected within the `file_table`. When the "OP" button is clicked:
    *   It gathers the paths of all selected items that are *files* (checking the size column for `<DIR>` text and `os.path.exists`).
    *   It tests the connection to the OPlayer device using `oplayer_service.test_connection()`.
    *   If files are selected and the connection is successful, it initiates a sequential upload process.
    *   The `_files_to_upload` list holds the queue, and `_start_next_upload` manages uploading them one by one using `oplayer_service.upload_file()`.
    *   The connected slots (`_on_upload_started`, `_on_upload_progress`, `_on_upload_completed`, `_on_upload_failed`) update the `UploadStatusOverlay`, showing the progress for the current file and indicating the overall sequence (e.g., "File 2 of 5"). Completion or failure of one upload triggers the start of the next via a short `QTimer` delay.

5.  **Sorting and Column Widths:** Standard table sorting is implemented via `_on_header_clicked` and `_update_sort_indicators`. Column widths are saved and loaded using the `SettingsManager` (key: `'ui/browser_table/column_widths'`) via the `_on_column_resized`, `_save_column_widths`, and `_load_column_widths` methods, preserving user preferences across sessions.

**Integration:**

The `BrowserPage` is registered in `music_player/ui/pages/__init__.py`, added to the sidebar configuration in `music_player_config.yaml`, and instantiated and added to the main application's page stack within `MusicPlayerDashboard.initialize_pages`.

## 7. Player Components Deep Dive

This section focuses on the widgets within `music_player/ui/vlc_player/`.

### 7.1 Main Player Integration (`main_player.py`)

*   `MainPlayer` acts as the central coordinator for playback.
*   It owns instances of `PlayerWidget` (the UI) and `VLCBackend` (the engine).
*   Connects UI signals (play, pause, seek, volume change) to backend actions.
*   Connects backend signals (state change, position, duration) to UI updates.
*   Manages application playback state (`app_state`).
*   Handles hotkeys via `HotkeyHandler`.
*   Provides methods like `load_media` initiated from the UI (`PlayerPage`).

### 7.2 Player Widget Architecture (`player_widget.py`)

*   `PlayerWidget` is the composite UI for the player, used both persistently and potentially in other contexts.
*   Contains instances of `AlbumArtDisplay`, `PlayerControls`, `PlayerTimeline`, `VolumeControl`, and `SpeedOverlay`.
*   Supports two layout modes via `_setup_persistent_ui()` and `_setup_standard_ui()` (though standard is marked as unused).
*   The persistent layout arranges components horizontally and vertically for the bottom bar.
*   Forwards signals from child components (e.g., `controls.play_clicked` becomes `self.play_requested`).
*   Provides methods to update its state (`set_playing_state`, `set_position`, `set_duration`, `set_volume`, `update_track_info`).

### 7.3 Controls and Sliders (`player_controls.py`, `custom_slider.py`, `player_timeline.py`, `volume_control.py`)

*   `PlayerControls`: Groups standard playback buttons (`PlayButton`, Next, Previous). Emits signals for user actions.
*   `CustomSlider`: Base class providing custom drawing logic for sliders to achieve a specific visual style (likely overriding `paintEvent`).
*   `PlayerTimeline`: Inherits `CustomSlider`. Visualizes track progress and current position. Emits `position_changed` when the user interacts with it. Includes a `PlayHead` overlay.
*   `VolumeControl`: Inherits `CustomSlider`. Controls playback volume. Emits `volume_changed`.

### 7.4 Timeline Visualization (`player_timeline.py`, `play_head.py`)

*   `PlayerTimeline` draws a custom slider bar.
*   `PlayHead` is a simple widget overlaid on the timeline slider handle to provide a distinct visual indicator.
*   `PlayerTimeline` manages displaying the current time and total duration labels, formatting them using `_format_time` (MM:SS).
*   Supports a `compact_mode` to hide track title/artist labels.

### 7.5 Album Art Display (`album_art_display.py`)

*   Displays track artwork.
*   Handles loading images from file paths (`set_image`).
*   Shows a placeholder SVG icon (`_set_placeholder`) if no artwork is available or fails to load.
*   Applies rounded corners conditionally based on the `corner_radius` parameter passed during initialization (defaults to original rounding logic if `None`). A radius of 0 results in sharp corners.
*   Scales the image to cover the widget area while maintaining aspect ratio (`Qt.AspectRatioMode.KeepAspectRatio` combined with manual scaling factor calculation for cover effect).
*   Resizes dynamically in its `resizeEvent`.
*   Emits a `clicked` signal upon a left mouse press.

### 7.6 Speed and Volume Controls (`speed_overlay.py`, `volume_control.py`)

*   `VolumeControl`: Provides a slider and potentially a mute button (implementation details might be in the base `CustomSlider` or specific overrides) to control volume via the `volume_changed` signal.
*   `SpeedOverlay`: A `QLabel` styled to look like an overlay. Appears temporarily when playback speed changes (`show_speed`), triggered by the `rate_changed` signal. Uses `QPropertyAnimation` for fade-out effect.

### 7.7 Overlay Management (`player_widget.py`, `player_page.py`)

*   Overlays (`SpeedOverlay`, `PlayHead`) and overlay-like elements (e.g., `open_file_button` on `PlayerPage`) are typically added as direct children of their intended parent widgets.
*   Positioning is handled manually using `setGeometry` or `move` within the parent widget's `resizeEvent` or relevant update methods (`set_rate`).
*   In `PlayerPage`, overlays are positioned relative to the page boundaries.
*   In `PlayerWidget`, the `SpeedOverlay` is positioned relative to the widget bounds, aligning vertically with the track title in persistent mode.
*   `raise_()` is used to ensure overlays appear on top of other sibling widgets.

## 8. Event Handling

### 8.1 Qt Signal/Slot Mechanism

The primary mechanism for communication and event handling is Qt's signal/slot system. This promotes loose coupling between components.

*   **Definition:** Signals are defined in class definitions (e.g., `play_requested = pyqtSignal()`). Slots are methods decorated with `@pyqtSlot()` or simply Python methods.
*   **Connection:** Signals are connected to slots using `signal.connect(slot_method)` (e.g., `self.controls.play_clicked.connect(self.play_requested)`).
*   **Emission:** Signals are emitted using `signal.emit(arguments)` (e.g., `self.play_requested.emit()`).

### 8.2 Event Propagation

Events often propagate up the component hierarchy:

*   A low-level widget (e.g., `PlayButton`) emits a specific signal (`clicked`).
*   Its parent (`PlayerControls`) catches it and emits a more semantic signal (`play_clicked`).
*   Its parent (`PlayerWidget`) catches that and emits an application-level signal (`play_requested`).
*   The controller (`MainPlayer`) catches the application-level signal and triggers the appropriate action.

Backend events propagate similarly: VLC event -> `VLCBackend` signal -> `MainPlayer` slot -> `PlayerWidget` method -> `PlayerControls` method.

### 8.3 Hotkey System (`hotkey_handler.py`)

*   `HotkeyHandler` intercepts keyboard events for the `MainPlayer`.
*   It maintains a dictionary (`self.hotkeys`) mapping `Qt.Key` values to specific action methods (`_toggle_play_pause`, `_seek_forward`, `_volume_up`, `_increase_playback_speed`, etc.).
*   The `handle_key_press` method checks if the pressed key is in the dictionary and calls the corresponding action method.
*   Actions typically involve calling methods on the `MainPlayer` instance (e.g., `self.main_player.play()`, `self.main_player.seek_relative()`).

### 8.4 Mouse Events

*   Standard Qt mouse events (`mousePressEvent`, `mouseMoveEvent`, `mouseReleaseEvent`) are likely overridden in custom widgets like `CustomSlider` (and thus `PlayerTimeline`, `VolumeControl`) to handle user interaction like dragging the slider handle.
*   Click events on buttons (`QPushButton`, `PlayButton`) are handled via the `clicked` signal.
*   `AlbumArtDisplay` overrides `mousePressEvent` to emit its `clicked` signal, which is used in `PlayerPage` to toggle play/pause.

### 8.5 Playback Event Flow

See Section 3.4 for a detailed example of the event flow during playback initiation.
Other flows:

*   **Seek:** `PlayerTimeline` detects mouse drag -> emits `position_changed(ms)` -> `MainPlayer` catches -> calls `backend.seek(ms)`. Backend emits `position_changed` -> `MainPlayer` catches -> calls `player_widget.set_position(ms)` -> `PlayerTimeline` updates visual position.
*   **Volume:** `VolumeControl` detects mouse drag -> emits `volume_changed(%)` -> `MainPlayer` catches -> calls `backend.set_volume(%)` and saves setting.
*   **Speed:** `HotkeyHandler` detects key -> calls `main_player.set_rate(rate)` -> `MainPlayer` calls `backend.set_rate(rate)` and `player_widget.set_rate(rate)` -> `PlayerWidget` calls `speed_overlay.show_speed(rate)`. `PlayerPage` also connects to `rate_changed` to show its overlay.

## 9. Styling and Theming

### 9.1 CSS-like Styling System

*   PyQt6 widgets support styling using Qt Style Sheets (QSS), which have a syntax similar to CSS.
*   Stylesheets can be applied to specific widgets using `widget.setStyleSheet("...")` or globally to the application using `app.setStyleSheet("...")`.
*   Selectors can target widget types (`QPushButton`), object names (`QLabel#pageTitle`), properties (`QLabel[property_name="value"]`), or dynamic states (`QPushButton:hover`).

### 9.2 Font Management (`run.py`, `dashboard.py`)

*   Custom fonts (`.ttf` files) are placed in the `music_player/fonts/` directory.
*   The `run.py` script explicitly loads these fonts at startup using `QFontDatabase.addApplicationFont()`.
*   It attempts to map loaded font files to logical categories ("default", "monospace", "title").
*   A global application font (`Geist`) is set on the `QApplication` instance.
*   Specific styles using different font families (e.g., `ICA Rubrik` for `QLabel#pageTitle`, `Geist Mono` for time labels) are applied via the application-level stylesheet in `run.py`.
*   `Dashboard.setup_fonts` contained earlier logic, but the primary font loading and application is now centralized in `run.py`.

### 9.3 Dark/Light Mode Support

*   The current implementation seems geared towards a dark theme, based on the color values (#1e1e1e, #2d2d2d, etc.) used in stylesheets and the `setup_dark_title_bar` call in `run.py`.
*   The `qt_base_app/theme/ThemeManager` likely provides the infrastructure for supporting multiple themes (e.g., loading different color palettes from config), although only one dark theme appears actively used.

### 9.4 Custom Styling Components

*   Widgets like `CustomSlider`, `PlayButton`, `AlbumArtDisplay` implement custom appearances, either through stylesheets or by overriding `paintEvent` for more complex drawing.
*   `AlbumArtDisplay` uses `QPainter` for rounded corners and placeholder drawing.
*   `CustomSlider` likely overrides `paintEvent` to draw the custom track/handle.

### 9.5 Dynamic Theme Switching

*   While the `ThemeManager` exists, dynamic switching at runtime isn't explicitly shown in the current player code. If implemented in `qt_base_app`, it would likely involve:
    *   A mechanism to reload theme colors.
    *   A way to signal widgets to update their styles (e.g., calling `style().unpolish()` and `polish()` or reapplying stylesheets).

## 10. Common Patterns and Solutions

### 10.1 Implementing Responsive Layouts

*   **Current:** Uses standard Qt layouts (HBox, VBox, Stacked) for basic structure. Overlays and some specific elements use manual `setGeometry`, updated in `resizeEvent`.
*   **Challenge:** Manual positioning is brittle and hard to maintain.
*   **Alternative (Discussed):** Using custom container widgets (like the proposed `OverlayContainer` or `ZStackWidget`) to encapsulate positioning logic relative to the container, or leveraging `QGridLayout` more extensively.
*   **Alternative (QML):** Integrating QML for parts of the UI would provide access to more declarative, flexbox-like layouts.

### 10.2 Creating Overlay Components

*   **Current:** Overlays (`SpeedOverlay`, `PlayHead`) are created as children of their intended parent and positioned manually using `setGeometry`. `raise_()` is used to ensure visibility.
*   **Challenge:** Positioning logic is scattered and relies on coordinate calculations within the parent's context.
*   **Alternative:** The `OverlayContainer` or `ZStackWidget` pattern centralizes overlay positioning logic.

### 10.3 Managing Media State

*   **Current:** `MainPlayer` holds the high-level application state (`self.app_state` using enums like `STATE_PLAYING`, `STATE_PAUSED`). `VLCBackend` manages the lower-level VLC player state and emits signals.
*   **Pattern:** The controller (`MainPlayer`) translates backend state changes into application states and updates the UI accordingly.
*   **Robustness:** Flags like `block_position_updates` are used to prevent UI jitter during state transitions or seeks.

### 10.4 Error Handling

*   `VLCBackend` catches potential errors during playback or media loading and emits an `error_occurred` signal.
*   `MainPlayer` connects this signal to a slot (`_show_error`) that displays a `QMessageBox.critical` dialog to the user.
*   File loading in `run.py` (fonts, icons) includes checks for file existence (`os.path.exists`, `Path.exists`).

### 10.5 Performance Optimization

*   Signal/slot connections are generally efficient.
*   Care is needed in `paintEvent` overrides (e.g., in `CustomSlider`) to ensure drawing is efficient.
*   Asynchronous operations (`media.parse_with_options`) prevent blocking the UI during metadata fetching.
*   Resource cleanup (`VLCBackend.cleanup`) is important to release VLC resources.

## 11. Development Workflow

### 11.1 Environment Setup

*   Uses **Poetry** for dependency management (`pyproject.toml`, `poetry.lock`).
*   Setup involves installing Poetry and running `poetry install` to create a virtual environment and install dependencies (PyQt6, python-vlc).
*   Requires VLC library to be installed separately on the system for `python-vlc` to function.

### 11.2 Running the Application

*   The main entry point is `run.py`.
*   Run from the project root directory using `poetry run python run.py` or `python run.py` after activating the Poetry environment (`poetry shell`).

### 11.3 Debugging Techniques

*   **Print Statements:** Simple `print()` statements were used extensively during development/debugging (e.g., tracking album art loading, signal emissions).
*   **Python Debugger:** Standard Python debugging tools (like `pdb` or IDE debuggers) can be used.
*   **Qt Tools:** Qt Creator or Qt Designer can be helpful for inspecting UI layouts (`.ui` files if used, though this project seems to build UI in code) and understanding Qt concepts.

### 11.4 Testing Strategies

*   No formal unit or integration tests are apparent in the current structure.
*   Testing seems primarily manual (running the application and visually checking features).
*   **Future:** Unit tests could be added for `VLCBackend` (mocking `python-vlc`), `HotkeyHandler`, and potentially utility functions. UI testing frameworks (like `pytest-qt`) could be used for integration/UI tests.

### 11.5 Common Issues and Solutions

*   **VLC Installation:** Ensuring the correct VLC library version is installed and accessible to `python-vlc`.
*   **Layout Problems:** Debugging manual positioning (`setGeometry`) issues, potentially refactoring to use layout managers or custom containers.
*   **Signal/Slot Errors:** Ensuring correct signal/slot signatures and connections.
*   **Platform Differences:** UI appearance or behavior might differ slightly between Windows, macOS, and Linux.

## 12. Extension Points

### 12.1 Adding New Pages

1.  Create a new `QWidget` subclass in `music_player/ui/pages/`.
2.  Design the UI for the new page.
3.  Add a corresponding item ID and title to the `Sidebar` configuration in `MusicPlayerDashboard`.
4.  Update the `page_mapping` in `MusicPlayerDashboard` to include the new page class.
5.  Connect any necessary signals from `MainPlayer` or other components if the page needs player information.

### 12.2 Creating Custom Components

1.  Create a new `QWidget` subclass (or subclass an existing Qt widget) in `music_player/ui/components/` or a relevant sub-package.
2.  Implement the component's UI and logic.
3.  Define necessary signals and slots for interaction.
4.  Integrate the component into existing pages or widgets.
5.  Use the `ThemeManager` for styling if appropriate.

### 12.3 Extending the VLC Backend

1.  Modify `VLCBackend` (`music_player/models/vlc_backend.py`).
2.  Add new methods for desired functionality (e.g., equalizer controls, chapter support).
3.  Interact with the `python-vlc` player or media objects.
4.  Define and emit new signals if necessary to communicate changes to the control layer.
5.  Update `MainPlayer` to expose or utilize the new backend functionality.

### 12.4 Supporting New Media Types

*   Primarily depends on the underlying VLC library's capabilities.
*   If specific handling or metadata extraction is needed for a new type, update the `load_media` and metadata logic in `VLCBackend`.

### 12.5 Plugin Architecture

*   Currently, no explicit plugin system exists.
*   Implementing one would involve defining plugin interfaces, a discovery mechanism (e.g., using entry points or scanning directories), and integrating plugins into the UI or backend.

## 13. Case Studies

### 13.1 Implementing the Speed Control Feature

1.  **Backend:** Added `set_rate(rate)` and `get_rate()` methods to `VLCBackend` using `player.set_rate()`. Ensured pitch correction is handled by VLC.
2.  **Control:** Added corresponding `set_rate(rate)` and `get_rate()` to `MainPlayer` to delegate to the backend.
3.  **UI Feedback (Overlay):** Created `SpeedOverlay` widget with styling and fade animation.
4.  **PlayerWidget:** Added `set_rate` method to trigger `speed_overlay.show_speed()` and emit `rate_changed` signal. Positioned the overlay (initially top-right, later centered).
5.  **PlayerPage:** Added another `SpeedOverlay` instance. Connected to `player_widget.rate_changed`. Positioned relative to album art.
6.  **Hotkeys:** Added methods (`_increase_playback_speed`, etc.) to `HotkeyHandler`. Mapped keys (`[`, `]`, `0`) to these methods in the `hotkeys` dictionary.

### 13.2 Fixing the Album Art Display System

1.  **Initial Problem:** Album art shown in persistent player thumbnail but not on `PlayerPage`.
2.  **Diagnosis:** `PlayerPage` connected its signals too late or didn't fetch initial state correctly. Its initial update logic was flawed.
3.  **Solution Step 1:** Added `last_metadata` storage and `get_current_track_metadata`/`get_current_artwork_path` methods to `MainPlayer`.
4.  **Solution Step 2:** Modified `PlayerPage.set_persistent_player` to immediately call the getter method and update its `AlbumArtDisplay`.
5.  **Solution Step 3:** Ensured `MainPlayer.on_media_changed` emitted `track_changed` *after* updating `last_metadata`.
6.  **Debugging:** Added extensive print statements to trace signal emission, connections, and artwork path propagation.

### 13.3 Refining Overlay Positioning & Layout (PlayerPage Example)

1.  **Initial Problem:** Manual `setGeometry` calls using absolute math led to fragile and incorrect positioning (e.g., overlay obscuring title, incorrect margins). `PlayerPage` used a `BaseCard`.
2.  **Refactor 1 (PlayerWidget):** Adjusted `setGeometry` Y-coordinate in persistent mode to be relative to `self.track_title.geometry().top()`.
3.  **Refactor 2 (PlayerPage Layout):** Removed `BaseCard`. Made `AlbumArtDisplay` a direct child of `PlayerPage`, filling the space (full bleed). Made "Open File" button and `SpeedOverlay` direct children of `PlayerPage`.
4.  **Refactor 3 (PlayerPage Positioning):** Positioned "Open File" button and `SpeedOverlay` using `move()` within `resizeEvent`, relative to the `PlayerPage` bounds (top-left and top-right respectively). Tuned margin values based on visual feedback.
5.  **Alternative (Discussed):** Refactoring to use layout managers or custom container widgets (`ZStackWidget`) for more robust, less manual positioning.

### 13.4 Developing the Playlist Management System

*   (Based on file existence - `playlists_page.py`)
*   Likely involves a `PlaylistsPage` widget.
*   Requires data structures to hold playlist information (list of track paths/metadata).
*   Needs UI elements for displaying playlists and tracks (e.g., `QListView`, `QTableView`).
*   Requires interaction logic: adding/removing tracks, saving/loading playlists (perhaps using `SettingsManager` or separate files).
*   Needs integration with `MainPlayer` to load and play tracks from the selected playlist.

## 14. Performance Considerations

### 14.1 Memory Management

*   Python's garbage collection handles most object cleanup.
*   Crucial to release VLC resources explicitly: `VLCBackend.cleanup()` calls `player.release()` and `instance.release()`.
*   Loading large numbers of tracks/playlists might require efficient data structures to avoid high memory usage.
*   Be mindful of large pixmaps (album art); ensure they are released when no longer needed if memory becomes an issue.

### 14.2 UI Responsiveness

*   Long-running operations (like extensive file scanning or complex metadata processing) should be moved off the main UI thread to prevent freezing. `VLCBackend` uses `media.parse_with_options()` which is partially asynchronous.
*   Over-rendering or complex `paintEvent` logic in custom widgets can slow down the UI. Profile if necessary.
*   Manual layout calculations in `resizeEvent` should be efficient.

### 14.3 Large Media Collection Handling

*   Not explicitly implemented yet, but loading thousands of tracks into memory for playlists could be slow and memory-intensive.
*   Consider database solutions (like SQLite) or lazy-loading techniques if handling very large libraries becomes a requirement.

### 14.4 Resource Cleanup

*   `VLCBackend.cleanup()` is essential.
*   Ensure Qt objects are properly parented or manually deleted if necessary to avoid memory leaks, although Python's GC and Qt's parent-child ownership usually handle this well.
*   Disconnect signals when widgets are destroyed if connections might persist beyond the object's lifetime (though Qt often handles this automatically for child objects).

### 14.5 Threading Model

*   Currently appears to be single-threaded (main UI thread).
*   VLC operations might happen on internal VLC threads, but communication back to Qt must be done via signals connected across threads (Qt handles this safely if done correctly) or using `QMetaObject.invokeMethod`.
*   For future features requiring background processing (e.g., library scanning), use `QThread` or `QThreadPool`.

## 15. Future Development

### 15.1 Planned Features (Potential)

*   Full implementation of Playlist saving/loading/editing.
*   Full implementation of the Preferences page.
*   Music library scanning and browsing.
*   Search functionality.
*   Equalizer controls.
*   Support for streaming URLs.
*   Database integration for library management.
*   More advanced metadata editing.
*   Visualizations.

### 15.2 Architectural Improvements

*   Refactor overlay positioning to use layout managers or custom container widgets instead of `setGeometry`.
*   Formalize state management, potentially using a dedicated state management pattern if complexity grows.
*   Improve separation between `MainPlayer` (controller) and `PlayerWidget` (view).
*   Introduce dependency injection for easier testing and component swapping.
*   Add comprehensive unit and integration tests.

### 15.3 Code Modernization Opportunities

*   Ensure consistent use of Python type hints.
*   Adopt async/await patterns if suitable for I/O-bound tasks (though Qt's event loop integration needs care).
*   Refactor large methods or classes.

### 15.4 Contributing Guidelines

*   (To be defined)
*   Likely include: code style guide (e.g., PEP 8), branching strategy, testing requirements, pull request process.

## Media State Management

### State Transitions in Our Media Player

Our media player implements a simplified state model compared to the underlying VLC library. The primary states are:

- **Playing**: Media is actively playing
- **Paused**: Media playback is temporarily suspended but can be resumed
- **Ended**: Media has reached its natural conclusion
- **Error**: An error occurred during playback

Notably, our architecture intentionally avoids exposing a "stopped" state to the user interface, as there is no stop button in our application. The "stopped" state exists only as an internal implementation detail in the VLC backend during media loading operations.

### State Flow Diagram
```
┌─────────┐     play     ┌─────────┐
│         │─────────────>│         │
│ Paused  │              │ Playing │

     │                        │ (media ends)
     │                        ▼
     │                   ┌─────────┐
     │                   │         │
     └──────────────────>│  Ended  │
          load new       │         │
           media         └─────────┘
```

### VLC Backend Implementation Notes

The VLC library provides its own set of states that don't perfectly map to our application states. The `VLCBackend` class handles this translation, ensuring that internal VLC states are correctly mapped to our application states.

Important implementation details:
- When VLC reports an `Ended` state, we emit an "ended" signal
- The `Stopped` state in VLC is used only during internal operations like loading new media
- State transitions should always follow the diagram above in normal operation
