## Multi-Segment Clipping Workflow

1. **Mark First Segment:**

   - Press `B` to set the beginning of your first segment
   - Seek to the end position of the first segment
   - Press `E` to complete the first segment

2. **Mark Additional Segments:**

   - Seek to the beginning of your next segment
   - Press `B` to set a new pending begin marker
   - Seek to the end of this segment
   - Press `E` to complete this segment
   - Repeat for as many segments as needed

3. **Manage Segments:**

   - Use `Shift + B` to cancel a pending begin marker
   - Use `Shift + E` to remove the last segment you added
   - Use `Shift + Delete` to start over and clear everything

4. **Create the Clip:**
   - Press `C` to merge all segments into a single output file
   - The segments will be automatically sorted and merged if they overlap

## Usage Notes

- **State Requirements:** Most navigation and clipping hotkeys only work when media is loaded and the player is in playing or paused state
- **Navigation Hierarchy:** The player provides multiple levels of seeking precision:
  - **Frame-level:** A/F keys move by exactly one frame (~33ms)
  - **Normal:** Left/Right arrows use the configured seek interval (default: 3 seconds)
  - **Fast:** Shift+Left/Right use 2x the seek interval (default: 6 seconds)
  - **Ultra Fast:** Ctrl+Left/Right use 4x the seek interval (default: 12 seconds)
- **Frame Navigation:** The A/F keys use a default of 30 FPS for frame calculation. For videos with different frame rates, the movement may not be perfectly frame-accurate
- **Clipping Output:** Clipped files are saved in the same directory as the original with a naming pattern like `filename(1).ext`, `filename(2).ext`, etc.
- **Hardware Acceleration:** Full-screen mode benefits from hardware acceleration when available

## Settings Integration

- **Seek Interval:** The Left/Right arrow seek distance can be configured in Preferences â†’ Seek interval
- **Volume Range:** Volume controls support a range of 0-200% for enhanced audio
- **Repeat Modes:** Use the UI controls for different repeat modes (All, One, Random)
