# Clipping Implementation Summary

## Completed Milestones

### Milestone 4: Post-Clipping Behavior ✅ COMPLETED

**Overview:** Implemented comprehensive post-clipping behavior that provides seamless user experience after successful clipping operations.

**Key Features Implemented:**

1. **Signal Connection & Handling:**

   - Connected `ClippingManager.clip_successful` and `clip_failed` signals to MainPlayer
   - Implemented `_on_clip_successful(original_path, clipped_path)` slot method
   - Implemented `_on_clip_failed(original_path, error_message)` slot method

2. **Post-Clipping Success Workflow:**

   - **Automatic Mode Switch:** Switches from playlist mode to single mode regardless of previous state
   - **Playlist Reference Clearing:** Clears `_current_playlist` to ensure clean single mode
   - **Media Loading:** Automatically loads the newly created clipped file
   - **Immediate Playback:** Starts playback from the beginning of the clipped content
   - **State Management:** Updates `current_media_path` to reference the new clipped file
   - **UI Updates:** Disables playlist controls for single mode operation
   - **Clipping State Reset:** Clears all markers and segments for fresh editing
   - **Focus Management:** Ensures hotkey functionality remains active
   - **Recently Played:** Adds the new clipped file to recently played items

3. **Error Handling:**
   - Displays detailed error messages for clipping failures
   - Preserves original media state and playback mode on failure
   - Maintains focus for continued hotkey functionality

### Milestone 7: Code Updates for New Specifications ✅ COMPLETED

**Overview:** Updated clipping hotkeys and filename generation to match new specifications.

**Key Changes Implemented:**

1. **Hotkey Updates:**

   - **Removed:** Old 'C' key mapping for clipping
   - **Added:** `Ctrl+S` combination for performing clipping operations
   - **State Validation:** Ensures `Ctrl+S` only works when media is loaded and player is in playing/paused state
   - **Updated Documentation:** Method signatures and comments reflect new hotkey combination

2. **Filename Generation Updates:**
   - **New Format:** Changed from `filename(1).ext` to `filename_clipped.ext`
   - **Conflict Resolution:** Implements progressive numbering: `filename_clipped_1.ext`, `filename_clipped_2.ext`, etc.
   - **Path Safety:** Maintains original directory and file extension
   - **Unique Generation:** Ensures no file overwrites by checking existence before creation

## Technical Implementation Details

### MainPlayer Integration

```python
# Signal connections in _connect_signals()
self.clipping_manager.clip_successful.connect(self._on_clip_successful)
self.clipping_manager.clip_failed.connect(self._on_clip_failed)

# Post-clipping success handling
def _on_clip_successful(self, original_path: str, clipped_path: str):
    # Mode switch, media loading, playback initiation

# Error handling
def _on_clip_failed(self, original_path: str, error_message: str):
    # Error display, state preservation
```

### HotkeyHandler Updates

```python
# Ctrl+S detection in handle_key_press()
elif modifiers == Qt.KeyboardModifier.ControlModifier:
    if key == Qt.Key.Key_S:
        if self.main_player.app_state in [STATE_PLAYING, STATE_PAUSED]:
            self._perform_clip()
            return True
```

### ClippingManager Filename Generation

```python
# New _clipped suffix format
base_clipped_filename = f"{stem}_clipped{ext}"
# With progressive numbering for conflicts
clipped_filename = f"{stem}_clipped_{counter}{ext}"
```

## User Experience Improvements

1. **Seamless Workflow:** After clipping, users immediately hear/see their clipped content
2. **Intuitive Controls:** `Ctrl+S` follows standard "save" conventions
3. **Clear Feedback:** Error messages provide specific information about failures
4. **State Consistency:** Automatic mode switching ensures proper UI state
5. **Clean Naming:** Descriptive filenames make it easy to identify clipped content

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Basic Clipping:** Test single and multi-segment clipping with `Ctrl+S`
2. **Mode Switching:** Verify playlist → single mode transition after clipping
3. **Error Handling:** Test with invalid segments, missing ffmpeg, etc.
4. **Filename Generation:** Test conflict resolution with existing `_clipped` files
5. **Focus Management:** Ensure hotkeys work after clipping operations
6. **Cross-Format:** Test with various audio/video formats

## Next Steps

- Milestone 5: Complete comprehensive testing suite
- Milestone 6: Already implemented (multi-segment clipping)
- Consider implementing optional UI buttons as alternatives to hotkeys
- Performance optimization for large media files
- Additional error recovery mechanisms
