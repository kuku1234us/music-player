# Documentation Writing Style

The documentations of our system is geared towards training junior developers. When writing documentation, it’s important to adopt a ​clear, essay/paragraph format, and tutorial-style approach, instead of using incomplete sentences or pure bullet points. Unlike bullet-pointed GitHub documentation, which is often concise and technical, your documentation should ​explain concepts in detail, provide ​context, and ​guide developers step-by-step. Rules to follow:
- ​Explain Why: Context first
- ​Be a tutor
- Explain the rationale behind design decisions that are not obvious or trivial
- ​Use Examples: Code snippets with explanations.
- ​Anticipate Questions: Address confusion points.
- ​Use Analogies on difficult/complex concepts: Relate to familiar concepts.
- ​Add Visuals, Ascii Diagrams
- Use complete sentences, paragraphs, essay style
- Use snippets of code to illustrate how the classes are built and use English to explain. Do not put entire code of a module in the documents and expect users to read it. The code modules are available for the users to read when needed, so the document should contain the tl;dr of only the important code snippets.
