# Rules About Playmode

1. In this app, the player is ALWAYS in one of three repeat modes:
REPEAT_ONE = "repeat_one"
REPEAT_ALL = "repeat_all"
REPEAT_RANDOM = "repeat_random"

2. The player is ALWAYS in one of the following states:
STATE_PLAYING = "playing"
STATE_PAUSED = "paused"
STATE_ENDED = "ended"
STATE_ERROR = "error"

Note 1: There is no "stopped" state.
Note 2: The STATE_ENDED is only a temporary interim state before one of the "repeat mode" mechanism kicks in, since the player is always in one of the three "repeat modes".

The above values are defined in [enums.py](mdc:music_player/ui/vlc_player/enums.py)](mdc:music_player/ui/vlc_player/enums.py)
